SPHERESERVER 0.51x  BUGS (12/31/24)
---------------------------------------
-magic reflection crashes server when bounceback

-spawned NPCs eventually lose spawn memory item, and a new spawn is produced resulting in multiples at the same location

-cant use MAXSTAM= MAXMANA= somehow they adds to damage and players are 1 hit killed

-npcs are still doing the machine gun bow thing

-COLORED NAMES on NPCs

![alt text](http://dragonsoftime.com/junk/colorednames.png)

```
TAG.NAME.HUE 021
NAMEHUE=021

<b>[ISSUE 12]</b><BR>
-Provocation - you can use provoc on player in guarded area, then call guards on them after it makes you attack them
check area for guards?  maybe cant be used on other players?  not really sure how provoc is supposed to work,
but i know i disabled it 18+ years ago for a reason, maybe provoc cant target a player?



<b>[ISSUE 14]</b><BR>
-see whos online?  maybe a way to see whos online?  .online command
maybe just use the hardcoded .admin menu and remove account information, maybe just a simple list with only characters names


<b>[ISSUE 15]</b><BR>
-the greatest thing about the new sphere is [FUNCTION  f_xxx]
you can make your own functions and solve just about any problem with a function
and TAG.YOURMOM=1 same as VAR. i think, but permanent, great way to tag characters and items for scripting


<b>[ISSUE 16]</b><BR>
-SECURITY!!! im sure all those antique injection hacks still work


<b>[ISSUE 17]</b><BR>
-tighten up loose ends, make sure all the skills do what they are supposed to =)


<b>[ISSUE 18]</b><BR>
-tillerman, arent you supposed to pin a map and drop it on the tiller man and hes supposed to go there?
https://www.uoguide.com/Map#:~:text=After%20plotting%20a%20course%2C%20you,to%20each%20point%20in%20order.
MAYBE DO THE SAME FOR NPCS TO WALK A PATH!!!!???


<b>[ISSUE 20]</b><BR>
-explosion potions, be able to set the low and high damage. you can raise the more 2, but the range is so big


<b>[ISSUE 21]</b><BR>
NEW TRIGGERS !!!???
	
--characters--

a trigger so NPCS will look at eachother 

ON=@SeeNewNPC ??  a way to get npcs to fight (besides berserker brain)
ON=@Timer  a way to get them to start a script, soon as they are spawned/summoned


<b>[ISSUE 24]</b><BR>
-magic resistance... no matter your skill, you take full spell damage, reistance doesnt work
https://web.archive.org/web/20000306034831fw_/http://uo.stratics.com/resistance.htm


<b>[ISSUE 25]</b><BR>
-multi and/or custom maps? seasons?


<b>[ISSUE 26]</b><BR>
-animal taming... <BR>even with 100.0 skill animals with high INT are almost impossible to tame (nightmares ect...)<BR>
<B>maybe decrease INT check by 50% ??? </b>


<b>[ISSUE 27]</b><BR>
-spell interupt? in 51a there is no spell interupt,<BR>
maybe added a SMALL chance (25% or less) of fizzling a spell when taking MELE damage (not archery) while casting


<b>[ISSUE 29]</b><BR>
-weapon speed in sphereitem.scp never worked<BR>
SPEED=<BR>
value no difference, BUT you could increase weight to adjust swing speed!
so not really a problem i guess


<b>[ISSUE 30]</b><BR>
NPC spell targets<BR>
NPCs always target player with spells...
if you add Greater Heal to monster spellbook, they should target themselves<BR>
Monsters should be able to use greater heal, dispel, magic reflection, cure...<BR>

<b>[ISSUE 31]</b><BR>
a wait timer? some way to have a DELAY before the next action
```
SAY Hello Friend
WAIT 4.0
SAY Why are you still standing there?
WAIT 7.0
SAY You are weirding me out, i'm leaving!
HOME 1456,230,0
```

<b>[ISSUE 32]</b><BR>
CAST DELAY for NPCs and MONSTERS?
so npcs with magery wont keep spamming spells over and over, and actually try to mele fight,
new sphereX has this
```
ON=@SpellCast
tag.NPCNoCastTill = <eval <serv.time> + <argn3> + 70>
```
maybe use the WAIT trigger from above? use an event...
```
ON=@SpellCast
WAIT 7.0
RETURN 0
```

<b>[ISSUE 33]</b><BR>
DE-Hardcode fishing items

<b>[ISSUE 34]</b><BR>
change poison to a HI and LO range instead of percentage based, one poison cast on a NPCs with 10000HP will drop him huge amounts of damage

<b>[ISSUE 35]</b><BR>
add a command to force NPCs to run,  RUNTO in new sphere


<P><BR><P><BR>
  
  SUMMARY - basically Lil Sphere by Fallout added some nice features to 0.51a, id like to add ALL those features
  and add a few new things and tidy up the 0.51a source for those who still have old server files...
  for those who dont know...<BR> there was a re-write 0.53 that changed the structure for what we know as the modern versions of Sphere, that
  0.53 is what lead up to 55i version alot of people used, this was BEFORE that... servers that used TUS, GreyServer, 0.48e. 0.51a... 1998 to 2000

FINISHED ITEMS!!!
---------------------------

<b>[ISSUE 01]</b><BR>
-HITPOINTS - on NPCS, there needs to be a seperation between STR and hitpoints, 
i want npc characters with 200STR AND 1000hp.<BR>
by default HITPOINTS will drain until they are equal with STR. so maybe add...
```
MAXHITS=1000
MAXSTAM=1000
MAXMANA=1000
```
and correct the regen???

so if players and npcs are over their maxhits, hp drains to equal their maxhits
and if players and npcs are under their maxhits, they heal to equal their maxhits not STR
	
![alt text](http://dragonsoftime.com/junk/maxstats2.png)

(optional)
AND FOR PLAYERS i want players to have x2 multiplyer for hitpoints, stamina, mana
so 
```
125 STR = 250 hitpoints
125 DEX = 250 stamina
125 INT = 250 mana
```
(this is option in sphere.ini of course!)

<b>[ISSUE 03]</b>

<b>[ DONE! ]</b>   
	
<b>[ISSUE 10]</b><BR>
-when you run from an npc with a bow, he shoots a LOT of arrow animations,  you get hit multiple times!
one arrow per step, so when a npc runs at you, its like a machine gun<BR>
<b>[ DONE! ]</b>   

<b>[ISSUE 11]</b><BR>

NEW TRIGGERS !!!???

--items--

ONTRIGGER=DROPON_ITEM   in source, but not finished

ONTRIGGER=CLICK  (single click) used for colored NAME.HUE!?

ONTRIGGER=ITEMCLICK  (single item click) used for colored item name?  NAME.HUE!?

ONTRIGGER=DROPON_SELF
	heres a nice lil bag script in the new sphere that will let you only drop runes in a bag...
 ```
	ONTRIGGER=DROPON_SELF
	IF !(<ARGO.TYPE>==20)
	SRC.SYSMESSAGE You may only place runes inside this bag.
	RETURN 1
	ENDIF

since there is no runebooks in 51a, a newbied bag that will only accept runes would be nice
	
<b>[ISSUE 22]</b><BR>

<b>[ISSUE 23]</b><BR>
